Most birds also have different types of wings while flying in the air. Some birdsâ€™ wings are more spread out for high agility or speed. These species have evolved very much throughout time. They have existed ever since the time of the dinosaurs, and adapted to different parts of the environment. There are many kinds of birds that are out there in the world. Red finches are birds that live throughout the United States and down into Mexico. These tiny birds have a beautiful song full of trills, chirps and rolling warbles. The male red finch is notable for the bright red feathers on his head and breast.

                  There are approximately 8.7 million different known species on Earth,
                  with studies suggesting that 86% of all land species and 91% of all sea species are yet to be discovered or noted.

                  The animal kingdom comprises only about 0.4% of the total living organisms on Earth;
                  plants comprise the most at 82%, and microscopic bacteria comes next at 13%.

                  Livestock outnumbers wild mammals and birds ten-to-one in order to satisfy the demands of human consumption:
                  livestock is 4% of the total animal biomass of the world, with wild mammals and birds at 0.38%.

                  Here is a closer look at the most populous animal on Earth.

Most birds also have different types of wings while flying in the air. Some birdsâ€™ wings are more spread out for high agility or speed. These species have evolved very much throughout time. They have existed ever since the time of the dinosaurs, and adapted to different parts of the environment. There are many kinds of birds that are out there in the world. We will look at the Red Finch Bird, the Blue Jay Bird, and the Conure Parrot Bird in more details in this website.

It is the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant on Earth. Traditionally, giraffes were thought to be one species, Giraffa camelopardalis, with nine subspecies. Most recently, researchers proposed dividing them into up to eight extant species due to new research into their mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, as well as morphological measurements. Seven other extinct species of Giraffa are known from the fossil record.
